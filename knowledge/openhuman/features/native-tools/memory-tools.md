# Memory Tools

The [[.obsidian-wiki/memory-tree|Memory Tree]] is OpenHuman's knowledge base. The memory tools are how the agent talks to it during a conversation.

## Tools in the family

| Tool     | What it does                                                                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recall` | Search the Memory Tree by query - source-scoped, topic-scoped, or global. Returns chunks with provenance.   |
| `store`  | Write a new memory the agent decided is worth keeping (a fact, a preference, a piece of context).           |
| `forget` | Remove a memory by ID - used when something is wrong, stale, or the user explicitly asks to forget it.      |

There is also a tree-aware retrieval surface (drill down a topic, fetch the global digest for a day) - the agent picks the right one based on the question.

## Why these are tools, not implicit context

The Memory Tree is too big to dump into every conversation. The tools let the model *ask* - "what do I know about Alice?", "what happened yesterday?", "remind me of last week's Stripe webhook" - and the retrieval layer returns just the relevant chunks, with provenance back to the source file in your Obsidian vault.
